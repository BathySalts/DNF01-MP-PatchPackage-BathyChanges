by THEBaratusII
I also give credits to those fixing this game.

NOTE : Due to mismatch problems, I'd advise everyone to check DukeForever.log first, because I was testing this with some friends and it was believed they installed a modified m_characters.Dtx (adding sunglasses) and had to use the original DTX file to finally connect.
